This project was created using codio to manipulate an existing database. If you wish to run either version, make sure that you have a MongoDB database (named "market") and collection(named "stocks") created from the stocks.json file, and the insert_input.json file is located in the default path the Final_Insert class will read from. The main class for each component of the java version is named "Application", thus if you wish for your project to contain more than one of them at a time be certain to rename them both in terms of file name and as it is defined in the code.

CS340 Final Java composes enhancement 1. Enhancement 2 is contained within the enhancement 2 narrative document, and refers to commands for querying MongoDB in general, but is intended for use with CS340 Final Python. Enhancement 3 is contained within the enhancement 3 narrative and does not strictly require the database associated with either version of the project, but can be performed with the mongo commands listed in the Replication Setup Commands documents included in the repository and is intended for use with CS340 Final Python.
